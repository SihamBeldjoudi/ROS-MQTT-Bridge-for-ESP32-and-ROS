This project establishes a bridge between ROS (Robot Operating System) and MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol, allowing ESP32 devices to communicate with ROS nodes through an MQTT broker. It enables message exchange between the ESP32 microcontroller and ROS, facilitating control and monitoring of devices connected to ROS from MQTT-enabled devices.
